Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm (C Implementation)
This repository features a professional implementation of Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm written in C. The project is designed with a focus on computational efficiency, dynamic memory management, and modular programming, making it an ideal demonstration of graph theory fundamentals for technical interviews.

🚀 Project Overview

Dijkstra's algorithm is the industry standard for finding the shortest path between a starting node and all other nodes in a weighted graph. Unlike basic implementations that use Adjacency Matrices this project utilizes Adjacency Lists to optimize memory usage for large and sparse graphs.
