Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm (C Implementation)This repository features a professional-grade implementation of Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm using the C programming language. Developed with a focus on computational efficiency and clean code principles, this project is part of my Data Structures and Algorithms portfolio.🚀 Project OverviewDijkstra's algorithm is a fundamental graph search algorithm that finds the shortest path between a starting node and all other nodes in a weighted graph.Why this implementation?Unlike basic implementations that use Adjacency Matrices ($O(V^2)$ space), this project utilizes Adjacency Lists to ensure space efficiency, making it ideal for large, sparse graphs.✨ Key FeaturesOptimized Memory Usage: Uses Adjacency Lists ($O(V + E)$ space complexity) instead of matrices.Dynamic Memory Management: Robust use of malloc and free for handling graph structures dynamically.Modular Architecture: The codebase is separated into logical functions for graph creation, edge manipulation, and the core algorithm logic.Ready-to-Run: Includes a sample graph to demonstrate pathfinding immediately upon execution.🛠 Technical DetailsData StructuresGraph Representation: Linked lists within an array (Adjacency List).State Tracking: Arrays for distance records and visited node tracking.Complexity AnalysisTime Complexity: $O(V^2)$ (Optimizable to $O(E \log V)$ with a priority queue/heap).Space Complexity: $O(V + E)$, which is efficient for real-world network data.
